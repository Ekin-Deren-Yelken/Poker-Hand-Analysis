Poker Hand Evaluator
This project is a console application written in C# that evaluates poker hands. It demonstrates my proficiency in object-oriented programming and modern software development practices.

Key Features:

Object-Oriented Design: Utilizes generics, interfaces, and encapsulation to implement a modular system for card conversion and hand evaluation.
Error Handling: Validates input data rigorously and manages nullable types to prevent runtime exceptions.
Test-Driven Development: Includes a suite of unit tests (using MSTest) that verify the correctness of hand evaluation logic, ensuring reliable functionality.
Technical Documentation: The code is well-commented and structured to facilitate maintenance and further development.
This project showcases my ability to design, implement, and test software routines, skills that are directly applicable to roles involving the development of robust and scalable systems.
